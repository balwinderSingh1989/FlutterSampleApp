Tried flutter for the first time and it took me 8 hours to learn the basics and develop with 3 screen app with material theme , list vieews and animations. 

My take from flutter after developing native android apps from 10 years is "Flutter is for kids :) " ..it's simplier and code might look clumsy if you are from native MVVM world.

Things i futher need to explore is app size and UI rendering performance.
